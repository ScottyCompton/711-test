# 711-test

I've completed this evaluation with the following notest/caveats:
<ol type="1">
<li>I used specific dimensions where they were indicated, and where not, used Photoshop or best guess to determine spacing and size of elements.</li>
<li>While it was not asked of me to do so, I added additional UX state checking of the Birthday select boxes.  I did not account for leap years</li>
<li>I used minimal Bootstrap</li>
<li>I used vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery) in all my scripting</li>
<li>I didn't feel like the standard Bootstrap form validation was suited to this exercise, so I wrote my own</li>
<li>I did not use a different size image for every resolution (was not indicated to do so)</li>
<li>There were some confusing aspects, such as the Phone number not being indicated as required but still having an error message, which I interpreted as if a phone number was provided, it needed to be properly fomatted</li>
<li>This has been tested on Google Chrome - I did not spend any time with any other browser</li>
<li>I used the chrome mobile device emulator for the mobile view</li>
</ol>
